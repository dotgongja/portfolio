    <h3>A little about me</h3>
    <p>I am a administrative professional, a new dad, and hopefully one day a front-end developer.</p>
    <p>I was born on the year the internet was invented (January 1, 1983), and so have grown up with the internet being available for most of my life.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm juggling work, being a dad, and taking the online Front-End development course at UW, but so far I am enjoying it.</p>
    <p>I hope to be able to create awesome websites some day, but in the meantime check out some projects that I have been working on by clicking the link below.</p>
